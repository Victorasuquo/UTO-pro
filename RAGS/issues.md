# GitHub Issues and Repositories Inquiry Tool

## Overview
This Python script allows users to interact with GitHub issues and repositories via a conversational interface. The script utilizes Langchain for natural language processing and AstraDB for storing vector embeddings of issues. Users can search for GitHub repositories and update the issues stored in the database, as well as query existing issues.

## Installation & Dependencies
To use this script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `dotenv`
- `requests`
- `langchain_openai`
- `langchain_astradb`
- `langchain`
- `github` (custom module assumed to be implemented)

Make sure to set up the environment variables in a `.env` file:
- `ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT`
- `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN`
- `ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE`

You can install required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv requests langchain git+https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain
```

## Usage
Run the script and follow the prompts to either search for GitHub repositories or ask questions about GitHub issues. You can quit the program by entering `q`.

Example interaction:
```
Do you want to search for repositories (r) or ask about issues (i)? (q to quit): r
Enter keywords to search GitHub repositories: automation
Top 5 repositories matching your query:
1. google/it-cert-automation-practice
2. user/sample-repo
...
Select a repository (1-5): 1
Issues updated for repository google/it-cert-automation-practice
```

## Function/Class Documentation

### `connect_to_vstore()`
- **Purpose**: Establishes a connection to the AstraDB vector store.
- **Input Parameters**: None.
- **Return**: Returns an `AstraDBVectorStore` object.

### `update_issues(owner: str, repo: str)`
- **Purpose**: Fetches and updates issues from a specified GitHub repository.
- **Input Parameters**:
  - `owner` (str): The GitHub username or organization name of the repository owner.
  - `repo` (str): The name of the repository from which to fetch issues.
- **Return**: None.

## Code Walkthrough
1. **Environment Setup**: Loads environment variables using `load_dotenv()`.
2. **Database Connection**:
   - `connect_to_vstore()` establishes a connection to AstraDB with necessary configurations such as API endpoint and application token.
3. **User Interaction**:
   - Prompts the user to either search for repositories or ask about GitHub issues.
   - If searching for repositories, it fetches a list based on user input and allows selection for issue updates.
   - If asking about issues, it utilizes a Langchain agent to respond to inquiries.
4. **Issues Management**:
   - The `update_issues` function fetches issues from the selected repository and updates the vector store.

## Example Output
When searching for repositories:
```
Top 5 repositories matching your query:
1. google/it-cert-automation-practice
2. user/sample-repo
...
```
When asking about issues:
```
Ask a question about github issues (q to quit): What are the open issues?
Output: There are 10 open issues in the repository.
```

## Error Handling
- The `update_issues` function includes a try-except block around the collection deletion to handle cases where the collection does not exist.
- Input validation is performed for repository selection and user action choices, prompting an error message for invalid entries.
