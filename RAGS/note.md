# Python Script Documentation: Note Saver Tool

## Overview
This script defines a simple tool, `note_tool`, that saves text notes to a local file named "notes.txt". The function appends each new note to the file, ensuring that multiple notes are stored sequentially.

## Installation & Dependencies
- **Python Version:** Python 3.x  
- **Dependencies:**  
  - The script imports the `tool` decorator from the `langchain_core.tools` module. Ensure that `langchain_core` is installed in your environment.  
  - Install via pip (if available):
    ```
    pip install langchain_core
    ```

## Usage
To use the script:
1. Ensure that `langchain_core` is installed.
2. Include or import the script in your Python project.
3. Call the decorated `note_tool` function with the text note you wish to save.

### Example:
```python
from your_script_filename import note_tool  # Replace with your file name

# Save a note
note_tool("This is a sample note.")
```
After running the script, the note will be appended to the `notes.txt` file in the same directory.

## Function Documentation

### note_tool(note)
- **Purpose:**  
  Saves the provided text note to a local file named "notes.txt". Each note is appended to the file with a newline character.

- **Parameters:**  
  - `note` (str): The text note to be saved.  
    *Description:* The content of the note that will be written into the file.

- **Return Value:**  
  - None  
    *Description:* The function performs a file append operation and does not return any value.

## Code Walkthrough
1. **Import Statement:**
   - `from langchain_core.tools import tool`  
     The script imports the `tool` decorator from the `langchain_core.tools` module. This decorator is likely used to register the function as a tool in a larger system.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `note_tool` is defined and decorated with `@tool`.  
   - **Docstring:**  
     Provides a brief description and details about the input argument.
   
3. **File Operation:**
   - Inside the function, the script opens the file `notes.txt` in append mode (`"a"`).  
   - The note provided as an argument is written to the file followed by a newline (`\n`), ensuring that each note starts on a new line.

4. **Closing the File:**
   - The `with open(...)` context manager is used to handle the file operations, ensuring that the file is properly closed after the note is written.

## Example Output
If you run:
```python
note_tool("Remember to update the documentation!")
```
The `notes.txt` file will be created (if it does not exist) or appended with the following line:
```
Remember to update the documentation!
```

## Error Handling
- **File Operations:**  
  The script uses a context manager (`with open(...) as f:`) which automatically handles file closing, even if an error occurs during the file operation.
- **Exception Handling:**  
  There is no explicit exception handling (such as try-except blocks) in this script. If an error occurs during file writing (e.g., due to permission issues), the error will be propagated to the caller.
