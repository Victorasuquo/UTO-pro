# Note Tool Script

## Overview
The Note Tool script is a simple utility that allows users to save text notes to a local file. Each note is appended to a file named `notes.txt`, enabling easy note-taking and retrieval.

## Installation & Dependencies
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `langchain-core`: This library is required for using the `@tool` decorator in the script.
- **Installation**: If you don't have `langchain-core` installed, you can do so via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install langchain-core
  ```

## Usage
To use the Note Tool script, you simply need to call the `note_tool` function with a string argument representing the note you want to save. Here's an example of how to run the script:

```python
from your_module import note_tool

# Save a note
note_tool("This is my first note.")
```

Each time you invoke `note_tool`, the new note will be appended to `notes.txt`.

## Function/Class Documentation

### `note_tool`
- **Purpose**: Saves a text note to a local file named `notes.txt`.
- **Input Parameters**:
  - `note` (str): The text note to save.
- **Return Values**: 
  - None

## Code Walkthrough
The script consists of the following key sections:

1. **Importing the Tool Decorator**:
   ```python
   from langchain_core.tools import tool
   ```
   This line imports the `tool` decorator from the `langchain_core` library, which is used to define a tool that can perform a specific action—in this case, saving notes.

2. **Defining the `note_tool` Function**:
   ```python
   @tool
   def note_tool(note):
       """
       saves a note to a local file
       
       Args:
           note: the text note to save
       """
       with open("notes.txt", "a") as f:
           f.write(note + "\n")
   ```
   The `note_tool` function is decorated with `@tool`, allowing it to function as a tool within the langchain framework. The function takes a string input (`note`), opens the `notes.txt` file in append mode, and writes the note followed by a newline character.

## Example Output
When you run the following code:
```python
note_tool("This is my second note.")
```
The contents of `notes.txt` would be:
```
This is my first note.
This is my second note.
```

## Error Handling
The current implementation does not include specific error handling mechanisms. If `notes.txt` cannot be opened (for example, due to permission issues), an exception will be raised. It is advisable to implement try-except blocks to gracefully handle such errors in a production environment.
