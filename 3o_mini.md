## Web Application & Project Workflow

- **[endpoint_.md](endpoint_.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Documents a Python Flask application that integrates OpenAI's GPT model with MongoDB for managing project workflows. The script provides endpoints to initialize a project state, generate user stories, answer project-related questions, and create development plans.

- **[Readme.md](Readme.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Provides a detailed overview of the project workflow. It covers the introduction, prerequisites, installation procedures, configuration details, usage guides, endpoint explanations, and other relevant information for running the Flask application.

---

## Comprehensive Project Documentation

- **[GENERAL_DOCUMENTATION.md](GENERAL_DOCUMENTATION.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Serves as a master documentation guide for the entire project. It outlines the various Python scripts, their functionalities, and how they fit together to manage project tasks, interact with GitHub, and support document querying.

---

## Documentation Generation

- **[generate_python_docs.md](generate_python_docs.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Describes the Python Documentation Generator script, which automates the creation of markdown documentation for Python files. It explains how the script scans a given directory for Python code, uses the OpenAI API to analyze the files, and then generates structured documentation automatically.

---

## Hello World Example

- **[test_aniebiet.md](test_aniebiet.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Documents a simple "Hello World" Python script that prints personalized greetings for Aniebiet and Victor. This file serves as an introductory example to demonstrate basic output functionality in Python without any external dependencies.

---

## Document Query Applications

- **[OpenAI-DeepSeek-RAG/deepseek_pdf_ui.md](OpenAI-DeepSeek-RAG/deepseek_pdf_ui.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Provides documentation for a Streamlit application that enables users to upload PDF documents, process them into a vector index, and perform queries against the document content using a Large Language Model (LLM).

- **[OpenAI-DeepSeek-RAG/openai_main.md](OpenAI-DeepSeek-RAG/openai_main.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Outlines a Document Question Answering (QA) system that leverages markdown documents, splits them into chunks, generates text embeddings with OpenAI, stores these in a ChromaDB collection, and facilitates querying to return concise answers.

- **[OpenAI-DeepSeek-RAG/openai_ui.md](OpenAI-DeepSeek-RAG/openai_ui.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Documents the Intelligent Document Query System (UTOM), a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload markdown documents, generate embeddings via OpenAI, and perform natural language queries to retrieve structured responses.

- **[OpenAI-DeepSeek-RAG/files/Readme.md](OpenAI-DeepSeek-RAG/files/Readme.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Contains project workflow documentation similar to the main Readme, specifically tailored for the OpenAI-DeepSeek-RAG folder. It provides an overview of the integration between the Flask app, MongoDB, and OpenAI’s GPT model.

## GitHub API & Repository Analysis

- **[RAGS/github.md](RAGS/github.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Documents the GitHub API Fetcher, a Python script that interacts with the GitHub API to fetch repository details and issues. It handles HTTP requests, environment variable configuration, and structures issue data for retrieval.

- **[RAGS/github_repos.md](RAGS/github_repos.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Describes a GitHub Repository Analyzer that searches for GitHub repositories based on user queries. The script fetches README files, computes semantic similarity against provided contexts, and can generate analysis reports including README summaries.

- **[RAGS/github_search.md](RAGS/github_search.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Focuses on searching repositories on GitHub using semantic similarity techniques. It details how the script integrates with a vector store to support retrieval augmented generation (RAG) by analyzing README content against a specified context.

- **[RAGS/issues.md](RAGS/issues.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Offers documentation for the GitHub Issues and Repositories Inquiry Tool. This script allows users to explore and update GitHub issues via a conversational interface using Langchain and AstraDB for data storage.

- **[RAGS/repo.md](RAGS/repo.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Provides details on another GitHub Repository Analyzer variant that facilitates searching for repositories based on keywords. It explains dependency requirements, GitHub API authentication, and usage instructions for searching and analyzing repositories.

- **[RAGS/repo_flow.md](RAGS/repo_flow.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Documents a script that enables users to interact with GitHub README files through a chat-like interface. The script leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to allow context-based Q&A on repository content.

---

## Note Taking Utility

- **[RAGS/note.md](RAGS/note.md)**  
  *Purpose*: Provides documentation for the Note Tool script, a utility that allows users to save and append text notes to a local file (`notes.txt`). It includes details on dependencies, usage examples, and function descriptions for the note-taking functionality.
