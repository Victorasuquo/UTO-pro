## Function/Class Documentation
This script does not contain any functions or classes as it consists solely of two print statements.

## Code Walkthrough
1. **Print Statement for Aniebiet**:
   ```python
   print("Hello, I'm Aniebiet")
   ```
   - This line executes the `print` function, sending "Hello, I'm Aniebiet" to the console.

2. **Print Statement for Victor**:
   ```python
   print("Hello, I'm Victor")
   ```
   - Similar to the previous line, this line executes the `print` function, sending "Hello, I'm Victor" to the console.

## Example Output
When the script is run, the expected output in the console will be:

```
Hello, I'm Aniebiet
Hello, I'm Victor
```

## Error Handling
This script does not incorporate any error handling mechanisms since it is straightforward and operates on guaranteed input/output scenarios without the risk of encountering exceptions. 

For any runtime errors, such errors would typically arise from issues unrelated to the script logic, such as the absence of Python on the system or trying to execute the script in a non-Python environment.
