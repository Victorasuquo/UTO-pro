# Simple Hello Messages Script Documentation

## Title
Simple Hello Messages Script

## Overview
This Python script is designed to display two distinct greeting messages in the console. Each greeting is printed in a separate line. The script demonstrates basic usage of the `print()` function in Python.

## Installation & Dependencies
- **Python Version:** The script requires Python 3.x.
- **Dependencies:** No external dependencies are required.

## Usage
To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `hello_messages.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `hello_messages.py` file.
4. Execute the script by running:
   ```
   python hello_messages.py
   ```
   
Upon execution, the script will output two greetings in the terminal.

## Function/Class Documentation
This script does not contain any functions or classes. It only contains two calls to the `print()` function which output greeting messages.

## Code Walkthrough
1. **First Print Statement**
   - The script calls `print("Hello, I'm Aniebiet")`.
   - This function call outputs the string *"Hello, I'm Aniebiet"* to the console.
   
2. **Second Print Statement**
   - The script calls `print("Hello, I'm Victor")`.
   - This function call outputs the string *"Hello, I'm Victor"* to the console.
   
The script executes these two print statements sequentially, displaying each greeting on its own line in the console.

## Example Output
When the script is executed, the console output will be:
```
Hello, I'm Aniebiet
Hello, I'm Victor
```

## Error Handling
- The script does not include explicit error handling mechanisms.
- Given the simplicity of the operations (i.e., printing static strings), Python's standard entry-point error handling is sufficient for this script.
